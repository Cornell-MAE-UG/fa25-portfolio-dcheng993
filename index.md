## About Me

My name is Dani, and I am currently a Sophomore majoring in Mechanical Engineering. I am from New York City and I love playing guitar, painting, skateboarding, and I've recently started getting into birding because of my friends here. I've always loved engineering and I'm hoping to get a carreer in the construction field, hopefully wokring on the mechanical equipment within buildings.
