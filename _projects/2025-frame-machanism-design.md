As part of Homework 4 in ENGRD 2020, we were tasked to design a 2D frame/mechanism that can lift the maximum possible weight to the highest possible height given certain parameters.

Such parameters were a catalog of linear actuators to choose from, a design space of 150cm wide and 50cm tall as well as 3 pin supports (2 of which need to be mounted on the ground). We were given the assumtion that all the supports and bar/actuator are rigid bodies.


The image of my design is located in </assets/images/frame-design.jpg>.

Assuming that the maximum height that the structure could be is 50 cm, then the actuator with an output force of 294 kN could lift the ost weight the 50 cm weight as it has a stroke length of 1.5 m, therefore achieving the goal of the design.
